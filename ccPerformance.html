<h3 id="modeltFordEnginePara"> Model T Ford Engine</h3>

	<p>The Ford Model T engine was a 2.9L four-cylinder
		<img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/modelTengine.jpg" title="Ford Model T Engine" alt= "Model T Engine" width="210" height="162"/>
	engine.</p>
	
	<p> It primarily ran on petrol, but could also use other fuels such as ethanol. </p>
	
	<p> The top speed attained was about 40 mph, and was about 20 horse-power.</p>
	
	<p> Production of the engine was continuous from 1908 until 1941.  
	After Ford stopped building the Model T in 1927, the engine was produced for commercial markets.
	It remained almost unchanged during that period. Starting was by hand-crank, for example.</p>
	
	<p> One interesting fact: the price of a Model T Ford in 1927 &#40;the whole car&#41; was about $260.  
	This translates to about $3000 in modern terms, according to <a href="http://news.thomasnet.com/IMT/archives/2005/08/have_you_ever_s.html">one source. </a></p>
	
<h3 id="jaguarXK6enginePara"> Jaguar XK6 Engine</h3>
	
	<p>The Jaguar XK6 engine six-cylinder engine is,
		<img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/jagXJengine1.jpg" title="Jaguar XJ Engine" alt= "Jaguar XJ Engine" width="200" height="162"/>
		by common consent, a classic design. The success of Jaguar depends largely on the reputation of this engine.
		</p>
	
	<p> It was produced continuously from 1949 until 1992, even surviving the era of electronic fuel injection.  </p>
		
	<p> It was designed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Lyons">Sir William Lyons </a> 
		and his team of designers consisting of 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Heynes">William Heynes  </a> &#40;the chief designer&#41;, 
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Hassan">Walter Hassan </a> 
		and Claude Baily.  </p>
		
	<p> The <a href="ccClassicCars.html#jaguarxj1Para">Jaguar XJ</a> used a 2.8L version of this engine</p>
	
<h3 id="astonMartinEnginePara"> Aston Martin Engine</h3>

	<p>The <a href="ccClassicCars.html#astonMartinPara">Aston Martin</a> Vanquish is powered by a forty-eight valve V12 engine,
			<img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/astonMartinDB5engine.jpg" title="Aston Martin DB5 Engine" alt= "Aston Martin DB5 engine" width="235" height="162"/> 
		which produces about 450 horse power.</p>
		
	<p> This engine was originally designed by 
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brown_%28entrepreneur%29">David Brown </a> and
	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._O._Bentley">W.O Bentley</a>, and established the racing pedigree of the Aston Martin firm.</p>
	<p> It was largely responsible for the company re-entering the Le Mans 24-hour race in 2009.</p>
	<p> The first <a href="ccClassicCars.html#astonMartinPara">Aston Martin</a> car contained a four-cylinder Coventry-Simplex engine.</p>

	
<h3 id="silverShadowEnginePara"> Silver Shadow V8 Engine</h3>
<p>All <a href="ccClassicCars.html#rollsRoycePara">Silver Shadows</a> contain a V8 
			<img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/silverShadowEngine1.jpg" title="Silver Shadow Engine" alt= "Silver Shadow Engine" width="210" height="162"/> 
		engine. At first the capacity was 6230cc, but this was later increaed to 6750cc</p>
	
	<p> A V8 engine is a V-engine with eight cylinders mounted on the crankcase, and all eight pistons drive a common crankcase. </p>
	
	<p> The V8 originated in France, but the first commerically produced engines 
		with eight cylinders on a V-shaped crankcase were produced by Cadillac 
		in the USA, around 1900.  </p>
		
<h3 id="fordMustangEnginepPara"> Ford Mustang V8 Engine</h3>

	<p>The <a href="ccMovies.html#bullittMoviePara">Ford Mustang</a> was also powered by a
		<img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/mustangEngine1.jpg" title="Ford Mustang Engine" alt= "Ford Mustang engine" width="210" height="162"/>
		V8 engine, and is considered one of the reasons this car was such a success.
		The Mustang was designed as a sports car coup&#233;, the so-called &quot;pony car&quot;, and which inspired many competitors.</p>
	
	<p>It was, however, the power of the V8 engine, for the first time in a sylish car available at
		a reasonably price, which greatly contributed to the success of this car.  </p>
		
	<p> As discussed <a href="ccMovies.html#bullittMoviePara">elsewhere</a> on this site, the famous car chase in the film <a href="ccMovies.html#bullittMoviePara">Bullitt</a>
		&#40;Starring Steve McQueen&#41; was also a major success factor, and is responsible for 
		the position the car holds in popular culture. </p>
