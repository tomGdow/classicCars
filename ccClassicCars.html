	introduced by Henry Ford in 1908, revolutionized the motor industry.</p>
	
	<p> It opened up the world of motoring to the general population, and set new standards in design and prodution. </p>
	
	<p> Not least was the use of an assembly line as a means of production, instead of making each car individually. </p>
	
	<p> Henry Ford was an innovator. Like Steve Jobs with the Apple Mac, he saw where the industry was going, and  the potential of motoring.
		As Ford himself put it: </p>
		<p class="quot"> If I had have asked the people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse.</p>
	
<h3 id="rollsRoycePara"> <span id= "ccPara2">Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow </span></h3>
	
	<p>The Rolls Royce Silver Shadow 
		<a href="ccClassicCars.html#astonMartinPara"><img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/rollsroyce1.jpg" title="Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow" alt= "Rolls Royce Silver Shadow" width="209" height="162"/></a>
		was manufactured in England and sold between 1965 and 1980, and is considered 
		by many to be the ultimate in a luxury car.</p>
	
	<p> It contained many innovative features, including a high-pressure hydraulic system,
		dual circuit breaking and a self-levelling suspension. </p>
		
	<p> Designed by John Polwhele Blatchley, and launched at the Paris motor show
		in 1965, it was the most technologically advanced car of its day. </p>
		
	<p> It was also the first Rolls-Royce designed to be user-driven, rather than chauffeur driven.
		There were 16,717 Silver Shadows sold during the twelve years of its manufacture.
		This seems remarkable for such and expensive car. 
		The price of a Siver Shadow in 1969 was $19,700.</p>
	
<h3 id="astonMartinPara"> <span id = "astonMartin1">Aston Martin DB5</span></h3>

	<p>The Aston Martin derives its name from one of the company founders, Lionel Martin,
			<a href="ccClassicCars.html#daimler12"><img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/astonMartin1.jpg" title= "Aston Martin DB5" alt= "Aston Martin Car" width="210" height="162"/></a> 
		and Aston Hill speed hill climb in Buckinghamshire, where the car originally used to race.</p>
		
	<p> It was originally designed by Martin and Robert Bamford as a bespoke high-quality sports car
		which was both a work of art and and exhilarating to drive. </p>
		
	<p> The Aston Martin DB5 became arguably the most famous car in the world after being driven by James Bond in Goldfinger. 
		Not only a work of art, this car was also famous for its gadgetry.</p>
		
	<p class="quot"> An eject seat?  You've got to be joking! &#40;Sean Connery as James Bond in Goldfinger&#41;.</p>
	
	<p class="quot"> I never joke about my work 007 &#40; Desmond Llewelyn as Q&#41;.</p>
	
<h3 id="daimler1Para"> <span id="daimler12">Daimeler 250</span> </h3>
	<p>The Daimler 250 
			<a href="ccClassicCars.html#jaguarxj1Para"><img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/daimler1.jpg" title= "Daimler 250" alt= "Daimler Car" width="205" height="162"/> </a>
		was a four-door saloon manufactured in Coventry, England, between 1967 - 1969. 
		It is a stylish, luxurious car.</p>
	
	<p> This car had many innovative features: an alternator &#40;instead of a dynamo&#41;, 
		negative earth electrical system, twin air-cleaned carburetors, ventilated leather upholstery, reclining front seats and a heated rear window. </p>
	<p> Power steering and overdrive were optional extras. </p>
	
	<p> The Daimler 250 had a V8 engine designed by Edward Turner.  It was the last car to have a Daimler engine after the company was acquired by Jaguar in 1960.
		Production of the Daimler 250 ceased in 1969, after just 17&nbsp;600 were manufactured.  </p>
		
<h3 id="jaguarxj1Para">Jaguar XJ </h3>

	<p>The Jaguar XJ
		<a href="ccClassicCars.html#modeltFordPara"><img class = "rightFloat" src = "./images/jaguarxj1.jpg" title= "Jaguar XJ" alt= "Jaguar XJ Car" width="197" height="162"/></a>
		began manufacture in September, 1968.
		It replaced the E-type Jaguar and contained a 2.5 L version of the famous Jaguar XK engine.
		Power steering and overdrive came as standard with this model, and air-conditioning was an optional extra.</p>
	
	<p>Designed under the leadership of Sir William Lyons for Jaguar owners 
		who wanted &quot;space pace and grace&quot;,
		the Jaguar XJ was a stylish, luxurious saloon car.</p>
		
	<p> This car is arguably Jaguar's greatest creation.  
	In the original television adverts, Sir William Lyons referred to this car as &quot;the finest Jaguar ever&quot;.</p>
	<p> Forty years on, it is hard to argue with him.</p>
